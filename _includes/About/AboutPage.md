<h2>This page was developed on a simple idea after I define my own issue and the idea is the solution for my issue.</h2>
<h3>My issues are: </h3>
<blockquote><h3><i>How do people know I'm a developer?</i></h3>
<h3><i>
If I build my own website, what about the cost for hosting and domain name? I'm working part time as a {% for image in site.static_files %} {% if image.path contains 'pictures/postPics/About/kitchenhand.jpg' %}
    <a class="hiddenlink" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" download="Superkitchenhand" alt="superman">kitchenhand</a>{% endif %}{% endfor %} to chase my coding dream.
Are there any free solutions for me?</i></h3></blockquote>

<h3>I've been worked with a lot of PHP solution such as WordPress, Joomla, OpenCart and Prestashop, but those projects do not make me recognized as a real coder.</h3> 
<h3><b>Something was wrong!</b></h3> 
<h3>So, I do some meditate and make up my mind. I should develop something. The thing which I'm not only <i>code something</i> for me but also <i>challenge myself</i>.</h3> 

<h2><b>OK. Let's get started.</b></h2>

<p>As a dev, my favorite playground is <a href="https://github.com" target='_blank'>GitHub</a> and luckily GitHub team providers <a href='https://pages.github.com' target='_blank'>GitHub Pages</a> a cool static website and 100% free. 
Whoa! This is extracted what I need. So, I make my hand dirty with <a href="https://git-scm.com" target='_blank'>Git CLI</a> and <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/" target='_blank'>GitHub Flow</a>; play around with <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/' target='_blank'>Jekyll</a>; learn some <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org/' target='_blank'>Ruby</a>; download some <a href='https://rubygems.org/' target='_blank'>Gems</a>, and challenge myself with <a href='https://angularjs.org/' target='_blank'>Angular</a> and <a href='https://material.angularjs.org' target='_blank'>Angular Material</a>, I also host this page on clouds like <a href='https://azure.microsoft.com' target='_blank'>Azure</a> and <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/' target='_blank'>AWS</a>.</p>
{% for image in site.static_files %} {% if image.path contains 'pictures/postPics/About/whoa.jpg' %}
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" alt="Whooooaa!" /> {% endif %} {% endfor %}
<h3><a href='http://odetocode.com/' target='_blank'>Voil√†</a>. Today, I proud to say I am a developer, I develop this pages. It's my playground as well as a blog to share with my technical issues and solutions I found.</h3>
