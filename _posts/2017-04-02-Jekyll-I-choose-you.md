Well, since I choose Jekyll and GitHub-Pages to build up my own blog platform, my consideration includes many free, well-known CMS solutions such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal …etc. However, I think I need an x-factor for myself, something makes me unique from a thousand bloggers out there (well, I can’t compare myself with English native speakers of course). </p>

<p>Blogging like a programmer or some article said blogging like a hacker. It sound serious, but if you try to remove the “marketing buzzwords” and get your hand dirty on Jekyll you need to code your own blog from scratch, a _blank page, now it sounds like Umbraco isn’t it, uhm...yeah, kind of but you need to fluent in Command Line Interface (CLI) now it sound scarier because most of the students learn, study and practice on Windows environment, a beautiful GUI environment with limited using CLI that make Git sound scary, read until here you may got my point, CLI will make me stand out :fingersCrossed:.</p>

<p>So, what is Jekyll? Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license (Wikipedia). That why GitHub-Pages dependencies runtime require Jekyll, and by the way, GitHub-Pages is a gem in RubyGems.org.
To dive in Jekyll for a Windows user, you need to set up Ruby environment locally with Chocolatey or Bash on Ubuntu on Window a built-in app on Windows 10 version 1607, for easy to develop and test, and use Git CLI for branching and deploying Jekyll to GitHub repo.
That’s it, that is how I choose and develop this blog on Jekyll, but wait a minute! ... There are thousands of developers out there using Jekyll and GitHub-Pages for their blog already, and I am too late, well that’s a drawback of not born sooner :(

 <p>I should challenge myself, I can make something different from them. Obviously, this is Clouds era and JavaScript frameworks, the churn of those techs make old folks hesitate to apply it to their blog. I got youth and stupidity, that the advantage of not born sooner :) to experience and establish on my blog. Luckily, I got a DreamSpark account for experience Azure, I also lost some “stupidity fee” for AWS when I tried free tier S3 with route 53. Everything seems to be ok, that the journey I chose.
