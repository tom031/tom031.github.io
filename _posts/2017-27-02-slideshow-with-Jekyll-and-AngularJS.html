When I try to build something that make my blog look different with others' blog, I thing about building a slide show Pics. <br/>
As you know, Jekyll was built on Liquid with limited features for DOM components. However, AngularJS and Angular Material are supported DOM with rich <b>UI/UX</b> design because they were made for building **SPA**. So that the concept programming that I building up for myself through all the years was right. That philosophy is "All programming languages can support each others, There is no something like 1 language rule them all". <br/>
<br/>

So I made it, a Slide Show of my gallery pictures which is a combination of <i>Liquid (Ruby)+ AngularJS + Angular Material</i>.
and this post I using <b>gist.github</b> to highlight code due to Ruby code still executing while highlighting.

<h1> It's Show time ! </h1>


{% include slideshow.html %}
<br/>
<i>NOTE: stop the DOM moving, you need to <b>Choose</b> one tab</i>
